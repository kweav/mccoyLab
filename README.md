Repository for primarily individual work carried out in the McCoy Lab

Projects include:

* Inferring Gene & CRE connections
* Paragraph genotyping of GTEx data to assess SV intolerant genes

`.md` files specific to projects, explaining what was done, and linking to scripts and results here, will be added to my private lab notebook repo.
